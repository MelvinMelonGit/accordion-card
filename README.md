Frontend Mentor Challenge

Hi there! Thanks for viewing my solution. I have a few questions.

1 - When do I use background image instead of a HTML img tag, (or even a pseudo element) to render an image? I tried experimenting the woman image and settled with a background image in desktop view and img tag for mobile.

2 - How do I prevent absolute position elements from moving when the accordion opens and closes

3 - How do I centralise my entire layout with absolute positioned elements?

4 - How may I improve on my code?

Thanks!
